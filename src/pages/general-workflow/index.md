# General Workflow for Lightroom API

The typical workflow involves making one or more calls to our API, to edit a PNG, JPG or other supported image files, and to create new image renditions.

As you begin integrating the Lightroom API into your workflow, there are a few considerations to keep in mind which we've outlined below:

## Supported input formats

All image formats compatible with Lightroom are likewise supported by the APIs. For a comprehensive list of these formats, please consult: https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/supported-file-formats.html

## Input and Output file storage

The Lightroom API works with any public or signed url. We have documented a few of the most common storage services and how to generate the urls programmatically.

**AWS S3:** Pre-signed GET/PUT URL. For more information about pre-signed urls on S3 you can go [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html). Here are some code samples that show you how to generate your pre-signed urls programmatically:
  - [Node.js](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/tree/main/sample-code/storage-app/aws-s3/presignedURLs.js) <br />Please note that creating pre-signed urls for AWS S3 requires signature version S3V4, as demonstrated in the sample code.
  - [Python](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/tree/main/sample-code/storage-app/azure/presignedURLs.py)


We also have a python [application](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/tree/main/sample-code/storage-app/aws-s3/example.py) that provides a working example of how to call our api using assets stored in AWS S3.   

**Google Drive:**: Signed GET/PUT URL. For more information on how to setup your Google drive account for access to creating a signed URL [here](https://www.labnol.org/google-api-service-account-220404). Here are some code samples for getting signed urls.
  - [Node.js](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/tree/main/sample-code/storage-app/googledrive/presignedURLs.js)

**Azure:** SAS (Shared Access Signature) for upload/download. For more information on how to generate a Shared Access Signature you can go [here](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-storage-blob/12.9.0/index.html). Here are some code samples for generating a url with Shared Access Signature.
  - [Node.js](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/tree/main/sample-code/storage-app/azure/presignedURLs.js)
  - [Python](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/tree/main/sample-code/storage-app/azure/presignedURLs.py)

**Dropbox:** Temporary upload/download URLs.  For more information on how to generate an upload/download you can go [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation). You can also create a file upload link for dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation#files-get_temporary_upload_link).  


**Note :** You can test to see if your public url or presigned url is working.

Run the curl command below to see if your input file path is working
  ```
  curl -X GET <Your file path> --output <some-file.jpg>
  ```
  If you are using a presigned url, put your file path within ""
  ```  
  curl -X GET "<Your file path>" --output <some-file.jpg>
  ```
Run the curl command below to see if your output file path is working
  ```
  curl -X PUT <Your file path> -d <some-file.txt>
  ```
  If you are using a presigned url, put your file path within ""
  ```
  curl -X PUT "<Your file path>" -d <some-file.txt>
  ```  


## Current Limitations
There are a few limitations to the APIs you should be aware of ahead of time.  
- Multi-part uploads and downloads are not yet supported.
- All the endpoints only support a single file input.
- Error handling is a work in progress. Sometimes you may not see the most helpful of messages.

## Retries
For increased reliability and stability we have added a retry mechanism for all API calls, and have some recommendations on how to handle these:
- The service will retry status codes of 429, 502, 503, 504 three times.
- You should only retry requests that have a 5xx response code. A 5xx error response indicates there was a problem processing the request on the server.
- You should implement an exponential back-off retry strategy with 3 retry attempts.
- You should not retry requests for any other response code.
