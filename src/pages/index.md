# Adobe Photoshop API-Firefly Services

Unlock the potential of Adobe Photoshop and cutting edge AI/ML services through an easy-to-use RESTful API.

## Overview

Welcome to the Adobe Photoshop API, now integrated into Firefly Services. Our API follows REST-like principles, utilizing standard HTTP response codes, verbs, and authentication methods that return JSON-encoded responses.
