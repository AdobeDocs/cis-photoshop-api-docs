# Adobe Photoshop API-Firefly Services

Unlock the potential of Adobe Photoshop and cutting edge AI/ML services through an easy-to-use RESTful API.

## Overview

Welcome to the Adobe Photoshop API, now integrated into Firefly Services. Our API follows REST-like principles, utilizing standard HTTP response codes, verbs, and authentication methods that return JSON-encoded responses. While the examples provided are in cURL, feel free to develop your application in any preferred language.

This guide will assist you in:
- Creating a project within the Adobe Developer Console

- Obtaining and authenticating your credentials

- Validating your credentials with a simple `Hello World` call

- Constructing personalized workflows by chaining API calls to various endpoints within the Firefly Services APIs

- Developing event-driven applications through Adobe I/O Events

Visit the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) page for a step-by-step walkthrough, covering project setup, credential acquisition, and initiating your first call to our `Hello World` endpoint for credential validation.
