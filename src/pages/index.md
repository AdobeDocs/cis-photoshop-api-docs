## Overview

The Adobe Photoshop API gives you access to a subset of Photoshop, Lightroom, and Sensei  services. The API will allow you to make both layer and document level edits to Photoshop PSD files as well as perform a number of image edits and improvements.

The Photoshop API is designed with REST like principles and uses standard HTTP response codes, verbs and authentication and returns JSON-encoded responses.
