# Adobe Photoshop API

Adobe Photoshop API provides the capability to edit images with Photoshop, Lightroom and Sensei services.

## Welcome to Photoshop API!

The Adobe Photoshop API gives you access to Photoshop, Lightroom and Sensei feature capabilities. The API will allow you to make both layer and document level edits to Photoshop PSD files as well as perform a number of image edits and improvements.

The Photoshop API is designed with REST like principles and uses standard HTTP response codes, verbs and authentication and returns JSON-encoded responses. The examples you see are written in cURL but you can use any language of your choice to interact with the API.

The [Getting Started](../getting-started/) page will walk you through how to use our API.


## Public Beta

The Photoshop API is open for free public trials. The trial is currently limited to 5,000 calls in a non production environment.

In order to gain access to the trial please [sign up](https://www.adobe-prerelease.com/sign-up/) here and follow the steps to generate your trial credentials.

Make sure to take a look at the Pre-release agreement and ensure you understand the aspects of the program.
