# Adobe Lightroom API - Firefly Services

Unlock the potential of Lightroom through an easy-to-use RESTful API.

## Overview

Welcome to the Adobe Lightroom API, now integrated into Firefly Services. Our API follows REST-like principles, utilizing standard HTTP response codes, verbs, and authentication methods that return JSON-encoded responses. While the examples provided are in cURL, feel free to develop your application in any preferred language.

This guide will assist you in:

- Creating a project within the Adobe Developer Console

- Obtaining and authenticating your credentials

- Validating your credentials with a simple "Hello World" call

- Programmatically generating XMP files from slider values and accessing other Lightroom features

- Constructing personalized workflows by chaining API calls to various endpoints within the Firefly Services APIs

- Developing event-driven applications through Adobe I/O Events

Visit the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) page for a step-by-step walkthrough, covering project setup, credential acquisition, and initiating your first call to our "Hello World" endpoint for credential validation.
