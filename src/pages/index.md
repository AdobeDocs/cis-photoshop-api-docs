# Adobe Photoshop API

Unlock the potential of Photoshop and cutting edge AI/ML services through an easy-to-use RESTful API.

## Welcome to Photoshop API!

The Photoshop API allows you to efficiently produce and scale content by automating repetitive, mundane tasks that would otherwise take time from a valuable creative or budget with outsourcing to an agency. Our API extends an organizationâ€™s capabilities to do more with the tools they already have at their fingertips.

- Create internal applications to help scale your content supply chain or build web applications to help unlock creativity anywhere.

- Generate thousands of variations and renditions within minutes instead of days.

## Overview

The Photoshop API will allow you to make both layer and document level edits to Photoshop PSD and other image files via a wide range of image editing features that span Photoshop and AI/ML services.

The Photoshop API is designed with REST-like principles and uses standard HTTP response codes, verbs and authentication that returns JSON-encoded responses. The [examples](../code-sample/) you see are written in cURL but we support the language of your choice.

The [Getting Started](../getting-started/) page will walk you through how to use our API.
