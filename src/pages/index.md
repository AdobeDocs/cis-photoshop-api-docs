# Adobe Photoshop API-Firefly Services

Unlock the potential of Adobe Photoshop and cutting edge AI/ML services through an easy-to-use RESTful API.

## Overview

Welcome to the Adobe Photoshop API, now integrated into Firefly Services. Our API follows REST-like principles, utilizing standard HTTP response codes, verbs, and authentication methods that return JSON-encoded responses. While the examples provided are in cURL, feel free to develop your application in any preferred language.

This guide will assist you in:
- Creating a project within the Adobe Developer Console

- Obtaining and authenticating your credentials

- Constructing personalized workflows by chaining API calls to various endpoints within the Firefly Services APIs

- Developing event-driven applications through Adobe I/O Events

## Discover

Follow the [Getting Started Guide](../guides/get-started.md) for step by step instructions on how to create your project in the Adobe Develper Console and obtain your credentials. 

Once you're ready to start building we recommend you take a look at the [Adobe Firefly Services SDK](./sdks/) It's a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline your development journey. All of the APIs included in Firefly Services can be accessed with this one SDK, all in one easy to find place.
