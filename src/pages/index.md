# Adobe Photoshop API

Unlock the potential of Photoshop, Lightroom, and cutting edge Sensei services through an easy-to-use RESTful API interface.

## Welcome to Photoshop API!

The API will allow you to make both layer and document level edits to Photoshop PSD and other image files via a wide range of image editing features that span Photoshop, Lightroom, and Sensei services.

The Photoshop API is designed with REST-like principles and uses standard HTTP response codes, verbs and authentication that returns JSON-encoded responses. The [examples](../photoshop-api-docs/code-sample/) you see are written in cURL but we support the language of your choice.

The [Getting Started](../photoshop-api-docs/getting-started/) page will walk you through how to use our API.
