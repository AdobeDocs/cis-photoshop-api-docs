# Getting started with Lightroom API

The first step in accessing the Lightroom API is making sure your organization is provisioned with access to Firefly Services. Once you have confirmed your have access you will need to create a project in the Adobe Developer Console and obtain a set of credentials. Follow the guide below create a project and make your first `hello world` call.

### Getting started from the Adobe Developer Console

 After you have confirmed you have access to Firefly Services you will need to create a project in developer console. If you have already obtained a set of credentials you can skip these steps.

1. Go to https://developer.adobe.com/console/home and **sign in to the Developer Console**.
2. Select **Create new project** under the **Quick start** section on the middle of your screen:

11. Once youâ€™ve created your token, you can follow the steps below to make your first API call.
   - Open your terminal and paste the code below.
   - Replace the variables "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" with the token you generated on Adobe I/O Console.
   - Replace <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>. You can find this on the same page you generated your token on.
   - Once all variables have been replaced you can run the command.

``` shell
curl --request GET \
  --url https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/hello \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  --header "x-api-key: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
```

If you are using Windows machine don't use the backslash for the curl commands. e.g
``` shell
curl --request GET --url https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/hello --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" --header "x-api-key: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
```
Congratulations! You just made your first request to the Photoshop API.

## Automate Token
Note that your token will expire every 60 minutes and will need to be refreshed after it expires. You can automate the token generation by referring to our sample code in node.js [here](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/blob/main/sample-code/service-principal-sample-app/index.js)

## Build something cool#
You have now Access Token and Client Id. You can use that to build your application using Photoshop API.
Check out this SDK and API documentation for that.
