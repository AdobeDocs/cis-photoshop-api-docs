## Overview
The Image Cutout API is powered by Sensei, Adobeâ€™s Artificial Intelligence Technology, and Photoshop. The API's can identify the main subject of an image and produce two types of outputs. You can create a greyscale [mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layers_(digital_image_editing)#Layer_mask) png file that you can composite onto the original image (or any other).  You can also create a cutout where the mask has already composited onto your original image so that everything except the main subject has been removed.


| Original        | Mask           | Cutout  |

## General Workflow

The typical workflow involves making an API POST call to the endpoint https://image.adobe.io/sensei for which the response will contain a link to check the status of the asynchronous job. Making a GET call to this link will return the status of the job and, eventually, the links to your generated output.
